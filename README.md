# MappingLidar
Respository for a mapping LIDAR.

# References
This mapping LIDAR was developed using Project Lighthouse's project, by arthur_dent, as a base ([Project Lighthouse - 360° Mini Arduino LiDAR](https://www.instructables.com/Project-Lighthouse-360-Mini-Arduino-LiDAR/) and uses lamik's drivers for the VL53L0x [VL53L0X_API_STM32_HAL](https://github.com/lamik/VL53L0X_API_STM32_HAL/tree/master).

# Components  
### Mechanical
The mechanical specifications and 3D printing files can be found in the Project Lighthouse post referenced above. So far, no mechanical changes were made.

### Electronics
2 VL53L0x LIDAR distance sensors, 1 MPU6050 gyroscope and accelerometer, 1 N20 DC motor (3V - 40 rpm), 1 360° rotating slip ring (6 channels).
